# leaflet-challenge

Using continuously updating data from the USGS, earthquakes from the past day were mapped onto a leaflet map. The magnitude of an earthquake is represented by the size of the circular markers. The depth of the earthquake is represented by the color the circular markers. Pop-ups that contain information on the earthquake's location, time, and magnitude come up when a circle is clicked. A legend is in the bottom right-hand corner. The map was creating using javascript and CSS styling.
